PACKAGE NAME MODIFICATION:
  The Python package name has been changed from "zen-mcp-server" to "martin-mcp-server"
  solely to avoid package name conflicts when installing alongside the original package.

  This is a technical fork for personal use, not a replacement or competing project.
  All credit for the original work goes to Fahad Gilani and Beehive Innovations.

MODIFICATIONS:
  - Python package name: "zen-mcp-server" → "martin-mcp-server" (pyproject.toml)
  - Virtual environment name: ".zen_venv" → ".martin_venv" (for local isolation)
  - Minor customizations may be added for personal workflow requirements

  All other branding, documentation, and functionality remain as per the original project.
